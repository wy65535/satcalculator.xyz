                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>SAT Score Calculator was created with a simple but important mission: to provide every student with free, accurate, and easy-to-use tools for calculating their SAT scores and planning their college journey. We believe that access to quality educational resources should not be limited by financial means, and every student deserves the tools they need to succeed.</p>

                    <h2>Why We Created This Tool</h2>
                    <p>Preparing for the SAT can be stressful and expensive. While there are many commercial test prep services available, we recognized that many students need a quick, reliable way to:</p>

                        <li>Calculate their SAT scores from practice tests</li>
                        <li>Track their progress over multiple test attempts</li>
                        <li>Understand their percentile rankings</li>
                        <li>Estimate their college admission chances</li>
                        <li>Calculate their superscore across multiple test dates</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How Our Calculator Works</h2>
                    <p>Our SAT Score Calculator uses the same conversion methodology employed by the College Board:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Raw Score Calculation:</strong> We count your correct answers in each section (there's no penalty for wrong answers)</li>
                        <li><strong>Test Score Conversion:</strong> Raw scores are converted to test scores (10-40 scale) for Reading and Writing</li>
                        <li><strong>Section Score Calculation:</strong> Test scores are combined and scaled to create section scores (200-800 for EBRW and Math)</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Score:</strong> Section scores are added together for your total SAT score (400-1600)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>All conversions use official College Board tables to ensure accuracy.</p>
