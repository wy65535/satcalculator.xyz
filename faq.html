                        <h3>How accurate is this SAT score calculator?</h3>
                        <p>Our calculator uses official College Board conversion tables to provide accurate score estimates based on the number of correct answers. The conversion tables are derived from actual SAT tests. However, keep in mind that the College Board may make slight adjustments to the conversion tables for different test administrations to account for variations in difficulty. Your actual scaled score may differ by 10-20 points from our estimate, but it should be very close.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is a good SAT score?</h3>
                        <p>A "good" SAT score depends on your college goals and target schools. Here's a general breakdown:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1500-1600:</strong> Exceptional - Competitive for Ivy League and top-tier schools</li>
                            <li><strong>1400-1490:</strong> Excellent - Competitive for selective colleges</li>
                            <li><strong>1300-1390:</strong> Very Good - Competitive for many quality colleges</li>
                            <li><strong>1200-1290:</strong> Above Average - Competitive for most colleges</li>
                            <li><strong>1000-1190:</strong> Average - The national average is around 1050</li>
                            <li><strong>Below 1000:</strong> Below Average - May need to retake for more options</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Research the average SAT scores for admitted students at your target colleges to set appropriate goals.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How is the SAT scored?</h3>
                        <p>The SAT is scored on a scale of 400-1600, combining two sections:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW):</strong> 200-800 points</li>
                            <li><strong>Math:</strong> 200-800 points</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each section combines test scores from multiple subtests:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reading Test: 52 questions → Test Score (10-40)</li>
                            <li>Writing and Language Test: 44 questions → Test Score (10-40)</li>
                            <li>Math Tests (No Calculator + Calculator): 58 total questions → Section Score (200-800)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is no penalty for wrong answers, so you should answer every question.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the difference between raw score and scaled score?</h3>
                        <p><strong>Raw Score:</strong> Simply the number of questions you answered correctly. For example, if you get 45 out of 52 reading questions correct, your raw score is 45.</p>
                        <p><strong>Scaled Score:</strong> The final score that appears on your score report (200-800 for each section). The College Board converts raw scores to scaled scores using conversion tables. This process, called "equating," ensures that scores are comparable across different test dates despite variations in difficulty.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is an SAT superscore?</h3>
                        <p>A superscore is the combination of your highest section scores across multiple SAT test dates. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Test 1: 650 EBRW + 700 Math = 1350</li>
                            <li>Test 2: 700 EBRW + 680 Math = 1380</li>
                            <li><strong>Superscore: 700 EBRW + 700 Math = 1400</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many colleges accept superscores, meaning they'll consider your best section scores even if they're from different test dates. Use our Superscore Calculator to see your best possible composite score!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Which colleges accept SAT superscores?</h3>
                        <p>Many colleges accept superscores, including most Ivy League schools and selective universities. However, policies vary:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Superscore Accepted:</strong> MIT, Stanford, Duke, Yale, Columbia, Penn, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Highest Single Sitting:</strong> Some schools like UC schools consider only your highest single-day score</li>
                            <li><strong>All Scores Considered:</strong> Some schools review all your scores</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Always check the specific policy for each college you're applying to on their admissions website.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Test Preparation and Strategy</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How many times should I take the SAT?</h3>
                        <p>Most students take the SAT 2-3 times. Here's the recommended approach:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>First Attempt:</strong> Spring of junior year (after completing relevant coursework)</li>
                            <li><strong>Second Attempt:</strong> Fall of senior year (if improvement is needed)</li>
                            <li><strong>Third Attempt:</strong> Only if you're confident you can significantly improve</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Taking the test more than 3 times is generally not recommended unless you have a strong reason to believe you'll improve. Focus on quality preparation between attempts rather than simply retaking multiple times.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much can I improve my SAT score?</h3>
                        <p>Score improvement varies by student, but here are typical ranges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>With Focused Preparation:</strong> 100-200 points improvement is common</li>
                            <li><strong>Significant Effort:</strong> 200-300 points improvement is possible</li>
                            <li><strong>Exceptional Cases:</strong> 300+ points improvement (typically from students who initially underperformed)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Improvement depends on your starting score, study habits, and the time invested in preparation. Students with lower initial scores often have more room for improvement.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long should I study for the SAT?</h3>
                        <p>Recommended study duration depends on your goals and starting point:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 1-2 months of consistent study (2-3 hours per week)</li>
                            <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> 3-4 months of regular study (4-5 hours per week)</li>
                            <li><strong>Comprehensive:</strong> 6+ months for significant score improvements</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Quality matters more than quantity. Focused, strategic practice is more effective than passive studying.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is there a penalty for guessing on the SAT?</h3>
                        <p>No! There is no penalty for wrong answers on the SAT. Your score is based solely on the number of correct answers. This means you should always guess if you don't know the answer - leaving a question blank is a guaranteed 0 points, but guessing gives you a chance at getting it right.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Percentiles and College Admissions</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What does my SAT percentile mean?</h3>
                        <p>Your percentile rank shows what percentage of test-takers scored at or below your score. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>90th percentile:</strong> You scored better than 90% of test-takers</li>
                            <li><strong>75th percentile:</strong> You scored better than 75% of test-takers</li>
                            <li><strong>50th percentile:</strong> You scored better than half of test-takers (median)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use our Percentile Calculator to see exactly where your score ranks nationally!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do all colleges require the SAT?</h3>
                        <p>No. Many colleges have adopted test-optional or test-flexible policies, especially after 2020. This means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Test-Optional:</strong> You can choose whether to submit SAT scores</li>
                            <li><strong>Test-Blind:</strong> Schools don't consider SAT scores at all (e.g., UC system)</li>
                            <li><strong>Test-Required:</strong> You must submit SAT or ACT scores</li>
                            <li><strong>Test-Flexible:</strong> You can submit alternative standardized tests</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Even at test-optional schools, a strong SAT score can strengthen your application.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How important is the SAT for college admissions?</h3>
                        <p>The importance varies by college, but the SAT is typically one factor among many:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Most Important:</strong> GPA and course rigor</li>
                            <li><strong>Very Important:</strong> SAT/ACT scores (at test-required schools)</li>
                            <li><strong>Important:</strong> Essays, extracurriculars, recommendations</li>
                            <li><strong>Considered:</strong> Other factors like demonstrated interest</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At highly selective schools, most admitted students have high SAT scores, but scores alone don't guarantee admission. A holistic application is essential.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What's the difference between the SAT and ACT?</h3>
                        <p>Both are accepted by all U.S. colleges. Key differences:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> SAT has 2 sections (EBRW, Math); ACT has 4 (English, Math, Reading, Science)</li>
                            <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> SAT is 400-1600; ACT is 1-36</li>
                            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> SAT gives more time per question</li>
                            <li><strong>Science:</strong> ACT includes a dedicated science section; SAT integrates science into other sections</li>
                            <li><strong>Math:</strong> SAT has a no-calculator section; ACT allows calculator throughout</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Take practice tests for both to see which suits you better!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is the Digital SAT?</h3>
                        <p>Starting in 2024, the SAT transitioned to a digital format. Key features:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Shorter:</strong> About 2 hours instead of 3 hours</li>
                            <li><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Question difficulty adjusts based on your performance</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital Testing:</strong> Taken on computer or tablet</li>

                        <p>Yes! Score Choice is a College Board feature that lets you choose which SAT test dates to send to colleges. However:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not all colleges allow Score Choice</li>
                            <li>Some schools require you to send all scores</li>
                            <li>Check each college's policy before using Score Choice</li>
                            <li>If you use Score Choice, you must send all scores from a single test date (can't mix sections from different dates unless the school superscores)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>When should I start preparing for the SAT?</h3>
                        <p>Ideal timeline:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sophomore Year:</strong> Begin familiarizing yourself with the test format</li>
                            <li><strong>Junior Year Fall:</strong> Start serious preparation</li>
                            <li><strong>Junior Year Spring:</strong> Take your first SAT</li>
                            <li><strong>Senior Year Fall:</strong> Retake if needed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Starting early reduces stress and allows time for improvement!</p>
